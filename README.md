The guessing project in C++ is a game designed to test the playerâ€™s luck and knowledge. 
The player needs to guess a random number generated by the computer. 
If the player guesses right, they will win a certain amount of money. 
The winning prize depends on the difficulty of the game. 
The program implements classes, functions, and user-defined data types. 
It also uses other features such as loops and conditionals to create a logical structure.
Furthermore, it makes use of the standard template library to implement basic operations and other data structures.
This project is done by 23aiml032, 23aiml043 and 23aiml034.
